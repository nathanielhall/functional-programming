## Semigroups & Monoids

- closed = working on certain data type that doesn't change
- associative
- identity
- semigroup = associative and closed
- monoid = semigroup with identity
- functor: semigroup that applies a function inside without changing the
  structure of the type

## Function Modeling

- Endo Functor
- contramap
- Mondad Transformers
- Free Monad
